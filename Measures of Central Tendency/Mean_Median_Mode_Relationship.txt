# Relationship Between Mean, Median, and Mode

Mean, Median, and Mode are three important measures of central tendency that provide insights into the center of a dataset. Each of them characterizes different aspects of the distribution.

## Mean

The mean, also known as the average, is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is a common measure used to represent the central value.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Mean (}\bar{x}\text{)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \]

## Median

The median is the middle value in a sorted or ordered dataset. It is not influenced by extreme values (outliers) and provides a robust measure of central tendency.

**Calculation:**
1. Arrange the data in ascending order.
2. If the number of observations (\(n\)) is odd, the median is the middle value.
3. If \(n\) is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all.

**Calculation:**
1. Identify the frequency of each value.
2. The value(s) with the highest frequency is the mode.

## Relationship

1. **Symmetry:**
   - For a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.
   - In a skewed distribution, the mean is typically pulled in the direction of the skewness, and the median is less affected.

2. **Skewness:**
   - In a positively skewed distribution (tail on the right), the mean is greater than the median.
   - In a negatively skewed distribution (tail on the left), the mean is less than the median.

3. **Outliers:**
   - Outliers can strongly influence the mean but have minimal impact on the median and mode.

4. **Multimodal Distributions:**
   - In multimodal distributions, where there are multiple modes, the mean may not accurately represent the central tendency.

Understanding the relationships between mean, median, and mode helps in interpreting the distribution of data and choosing appropriate measures for analysis.

Remember that each measure has its strengths and limitations, and the choice depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis.
