# Types of Bar Diagrams

## Simple Bar Diagrams

Simple bar diagrams are the most basic type. They consist of rectangular bars of equal width, each representing a category or group. The length of the bar corresponds to the value it represents.

## Subdivided/Component Bar Diagrams

In subdivided or component bar diagrams, each bar is divided into sections or components, with each section representing a sub-category or component of the main category. This is useful for showing the composition of each category.

## Multiple Bar Diagrams

Multiple bar diagrams involve displaying multiple bars for each category, typically side by side. This allows for the comparison of values across different subcategories within each main category.

## Percentage Bar Diagram

Percentage bar diagrams represent the percentage distribution of different subcategories within each main category. The total length of each bar represents 100%, and each segment corresponds to the percentage of a specific subcategory.

## Deviation Bars

Deviation bars are used to show the deviation of values from a reference point. The bars extend above or below the reference line, indicating positive or negative deviations.

## Broken Bars

Broken bars are used when there is a break in the scale of the data. For example, if there is a significant gap between two values, a break may be introduced in the bar to avoid a long, misleading bar.
